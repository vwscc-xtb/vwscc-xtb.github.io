# {{ page.title }}

A frequent experiment in computational chemistry is mechanism elucidation which requires reaction path searches. Of course the here presented example is so small that a DFT path search would easily be doable but for the sake of simplicity we nevertheless go for a plain Diels-Alder reaction at the *GFN2-xTB* (gas) level.

## Optional Exercise

Build the input structures (buta-1,3-diene and but-2-ene) yourself with a molecular editor, e.g. avogadro. Pay attention that the atom order is the same in the start and end structure.
